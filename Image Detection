Image Detection (Deep Learning)

Main Functions
1. Facial recognition [by Anqi & Qianhan]
    Objective:
    - identity check
    - the same face must be captured by frontal camera all the time during the exam
    - no other face being detcted during the exam
    Current Research Progress:
    - 使用Tensorflow lite模型或Pytorch mobile模型
    - 将pre-train model部署在移动端
    - Tensorflow lite：https://www.tensorflow.org/lite
        Image detection model on tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview
    - Pytorch mobile: https://pytorch.org/mobile/home/
        Image detection model on pytorch: https://github.com/pytorch/android-demo-app/tree/master/ObjectDetection
    - Available free facial recognition SDK：ArcSoft：https://ai.arcsoft.com.cn/course/index.html

2. Hand positions recognition [by Shuyu & Guangyao]
    Objective:
    - for detecting cheating behaviours, e.g. checking the notes

3. Movement detction 动作检测（扭头，低头)    
4. Abnornal behaviour video clip playback 异常片段回放
5. Save the whole video after the exam 考试结束后视频保存
